## History time
So it all started a while back... I went on YouTube to watch videos, and I watched an Australian guy that yells at iPods...
I got _a m a z e d_ by the magic âœ¨ of iPods and y'know, Apple ain't making them anymore, so uhh...
uh... I decided to make my own! Well without any budget at all, the project started, unfornately I can't sell (nor make) them, since no budget, but I wasn't gonna give up! I still  want to do all that
